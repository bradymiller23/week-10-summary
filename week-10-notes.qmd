**BRING IN NOTES FROM LAST WEEK**

Logistic Lost Function

* AKA kl-divergence --> probability distributions match in areas where you have 
  most data
```{r}
nn_bce_loss()
```


```r
L2 <- function(x, y, model){
  nn_bce_loss()(model(x),y)
}

logistic_reg_2 <- module()
L2(x_tensor, y_tensor, logistic_reg_2)
```


```{r}
